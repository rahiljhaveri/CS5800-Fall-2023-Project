# Abstract
In the context of healthcare resource allocation, efficient routing of medical supplies and personnel is critical to ensure timely and effective response to health emergencies. This project assesses the application of Dijkstra's Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithm and the Floyd-Warshall All Source Shortest Path (ASSP) algorithm in optimizing healthcare resource allocation. The study focuses on a graph representation of Maine State's 49 interconnected hospitals using road networks. By modeling hospitals as nodes and roads as edges with weights indicating distances, the research aims to identify efficient routes for resource transport. The evaluation criteria include computational efficiency, scalability, and practicality. Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented for single-source shortest paths, contrasting its performance with the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which calculates all source shortest paths. Factors such as algorithmic complexity, execution time, and memory usage are considered. The project also explores algorithmic sensitivity to changes in the network structure, simulating scenarios like adding or removing hospital nodes. This analysis assesses algorithm adaptability to dynamic healthcare infrastructures. The study's findings offer insights into the suitability of Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall algorithms for healthcare resource allocation, contributing to discussions on algorithm selection for optimizing healthcare logistics. The results may guide decision-making processes for improving emergency response and resource management in the healthcare sector.

# Problem Statement
"How can healthcare facilities develop an efficient blood distribution plan using algorithms to minimize costs, maximize patient outcomes, find shortest routes from neighboring hospitals to meet blood requirements and save routes for future use?"

# Our Aim
There is a requirement to develop an optimized healthcare/medical resource allocation plan that ensures efficient and effective healthcare delivery minimizing the cost and maximizing the patient outcomes. In our case, it is blood; the perishable fluid which keeps us alive. We aim to implement the algorithm on the healthcare facilities network with nodes representing healthcare facilities like hospitals, blood banks and collection centers and edges representing the transportation routes. We aim to find the shortest route to get blood as per requirement in a hospital (source node) from nearby neighboring hospitals (other nodes in the network). Also, we plan to save this route in order to consume less time for calculating the shortest route in future. These transportation routes will also be utilized to transfer blood units before they expire. In our scope, we would analyze & compare the single source shortest path algorithm, Dijkstra Algorithm, and all source shortest path algorithm, Floyd Warshall Algorithm.
